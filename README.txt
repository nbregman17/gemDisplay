This program displays an image on the Gem board.

Input: assigned values to red, green, and blue unsigned 8 bit arrays.
Output: arduino displays image on Gem

The values of red, green, blue are pasted in from the red.txt, green.txt, and blue.txt output files from the to-block project.
This requires a minimal amount of manual copying and pasting, but it is the best solution in this case.  The pre-processing is done on a computer and the values are given to the arduino in order to minimize the computational work required of the arduino.
